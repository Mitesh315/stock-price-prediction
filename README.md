## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task, and this project provides an example of how to approach it using various machine learning algorithms.

**Key Features**:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Building and training stock price prediction models.
- Visualizing and evaluating model performance.
- Making predictions on future stock prices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Visual Studio Code.
- 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mitesh315/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The data used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. The dataset contains historical stock price data for training and testing purposes. You can replace it with your own data if needed.

## Model

We have implemented various machine learning models for stock price prediction, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost regressor

The model files and code can be found in the `models` directory.

## Results

We have evaluated the models' performance using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). You can find the results in the `results` directory.
